                  Board games and card games are something I have always had alot of enjoyment in. Not only do you get to spend some time with friends sometimes you can come across moments that are like puzzles.
                  Whether you are playing a cooperative game or a game against each other, strategy is where the fun comes in... especially when it works. When I was younger I played a good amount of chess and started my own chess club,
                  and this is where all my experience comes from. Although I did read books on chess trying to get better at it, years away from playing chess has made me pretty rusty. 
                  If there is somewhere you would like to jump to you can do that at one of the links below, otherwise I hope you can learn something from a chess noob like me.

                     <h3>Setup And Initial Rules</h3>

                        <p>

                        Chess is a game set up on a board that consists of squares alternating back and forth between two colors. When setting up the board,
                        position the chess board so that the lighter colored square is on the right side of each player. On the second row from each player the smallest pieces called pawns
                        will be set up on each of the eight squares. The closest row to each player, in order will be set up left to right starting with the rook, knight, and then the bishop.
                        After the first three pieces each player will place their queen on the middle square corresponding with that players color, so that the queens of each player are placed in the same column.
                        Place your king on the other middle square and then place your remaining pieces so that they are cemetrical with your left side of the board, starting from the middle, the bishop, knight, and
                        then the rook on the last remaining space.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                        Chess is a turn based game, where players will alternate taking their turns to move pieces around or capture an opponents piece. When moving a piece, with the exception of the knight, 
                        a player may not move a piece past another piece. When capturing an opponents piece move your piece into a square occupied by an opponents piece and set your opponents piece to the side
                        of the board. You may not move a piece into the same square as another piece with the exception of capturing. Chess is a game which will assign a point value with each different piece as a 
                        way to show the worth of a piece. Although they have points assign with the pieces, the game still only has one way to win, and I encourage you not to think about the points of piece, given
                        the circumstances of a boards state, you can still win a game even if you are down several points compared to your opponent.

                        </p>

                     <h3>Rook (Also Known As Castles)</h3>

                        <p>

                        Although they are often refered to as castles, I discourage you to do so, as to prevent you from getting confused with a special move called <em><a href="#SpecialRules">castling</a></em>, which I will go over later.
                        Rooks are a piece that can move as many spaces as it would like vertically or horizontally on the board, as long as all the squares are not being occupied. Although rooks typically won't see much
                        play in the early game, they become very strong in the end game once there are less pieces crowding up the board. Rooks have a point value of 5.

                        </p>

                     <h3>Knight (Also Known As Horses)</h3>

                        <p>

                           Knights can often be refered to as horses by players who don't know the game very well, and can also be a good way of explaining how they move. Knights are the only piece that
                           can jump over pieces. This means that they can be strong in a <em>closed</em> game, meaning a game where not very many pieces have been captured yet. Knights move in a shape of an "L",
                           moving two spaces, or squares, in a horizontal or vertical manner and one space in the other manner. Because these pieces can jump over pieces you do not need to worry about any spaces
                           in between or any pieces that it could run into. Knights are considered to have 3 points.

                        </p>

                     <h3>Bishop (Also Known As That Pointed Piece)</h3>

                        <p>

                           I have never heard the bishop refered to as "that pointed piece" but I felt they needed a nick-name just like the others. Bishops move as many spaces as they would like in a diagonal direction given
                           all spaces in between are not being occupied. Just like rooks, they are very strong in an <em>open</em> game, meaning a game where there are alot of available spaces to move and a game
                           where many trades have happened already. Bishops have 3 points just like knights. They are considered to be equal in points but depending on whether its a open or closed game, one can prove
                           to be more useful than the other.

                        </p>

                     <h3>Queen (Also Known As The Best Piece)</h3>

                        <p>

                           Anyone that has played chess a decent amount know that the queen is a very powerful piece, but it is considered unwise to move the queen out onto the board too quickly. While you are stuck
                           moving your queen around to protect her from from your opponents threats, your opponent is able to get many pieces out onto the board and is given more time to set up an attack. Queens can move in
                           the same way as both the rook and the bishop combined, and so she recieves the combined point total of 8.

                        </p>

                     <h3>King (Also Known As The Most Important Piece)</h3>

                        <p>

                           Although the King is the most important piece they are not very strong. A king can only be moved one square at a time in any direction he wishes. In a game of chess, it is important to keep your king
                           in a safe area, the king is to be protected at all costs, and you lose the game if your king is captured. The king does not have a point value.

                        </p>

                     <h3>Pawn (In Their Own Way, Are Also The Best Piece)</h3>

                        <p>

                           Although pawns can be considered easily disposable, pawns become very important pieces in the end game. On their very first move, they can be moved two squares forward, after that they are restricted
                           to moving only one space forward (vertically) and cannot be moved in any other direction. Unlike other pieces, pawns capture differently than how they are moved. Every other piece can capture any piece they can move to,
                           for pawns, they can only capture one space diagonally forward. Pawns have a special rule attached to them however, once a pawn has moved across the board to the last row on the opponent's side of the board,
                           they can be <em>promoted</em> to any other piece (besides the king). This means that a pawn will become any other piece that the player chooses, most commonly, they become another queen. Pawns have another special rule, less
                           commonly known, called "<em><a href="#SpecialRules">en passant</a></em>", but I'll go over this later. Pawn's have a point value of one.

                  <h2><a id="HowToWin">How To Win The Game</a></h2>

                     <p>

                        As I have already said, there is a point system in chess, but that is not what decides whether you win a certain game or not. Points are more used to the worth of a piece and to determine how far down a person
                        is in comparison their opponent. To win the game of chess, you must check-mate your opponents king. Check-mating means to threaten to capture an opponents king, and the opponent has no moves to stop the capture,
                        for example, the opponent can't take the piece threatening the capture, can't move the king to any safe square, or block the capture of their king with the use of another piece. When a piece threatens to capture
                        the opponents king, but their are still playable moves, this is considered a "check". Putting someone in check is a forcing move, that forces your oppenent to make certain moves they may not want to do, to avoid capture,
                        and can be an effective way of gaining an advantage against your opponent.
