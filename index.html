            Board games and card games are something I have always had alot of enjoyment in. Not only do you get to spend some time with friends sometimes you can come across moments that are like puzzles.
            Whether you are playing a cooperative game or a game against each other, strategy is where the fun comes in... especially when it works. When I was younger I played a good amount of chess and started my own chess club,
            and this is where all my experience comes from. Although I did read books on chess trying to get better at it, years away from playing chess has made me pretty rusty. 
            If there is somewhere you would like to jump to you can do that at one of the links below, otherwise I hope you can learn something from a chess noob like me.
